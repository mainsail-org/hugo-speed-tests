# README 

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is an open source static site generator implemented in golang. It is what I use for paulromer.net. Hugo's site brags about being "The worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites". It is implemented in golang and takes advantage of paralell processing.

This repo has scripts for running stress tests on hugo and capturing the test results in csv format for data analysis.

The goal is to:
- measure how fast hugo really is and compare it to other site generators, and compare the speed of different versions of hugo,  
- measure the impact of that speed on saving in CO2 emissions (applicable for really large scale projects like building all of github pages),  
- explore the efficiency of optimizing a theme and tweaking build parameters.
 
The scripts will not work on Windows. It was tested on OsX and Ubuntu.

# What's in this directory?

- `sample-content/`: a directory with a sample post and 5 images. It is meant to represent an "average" post. It can be modified to test for different type of content.  
- `generate.sh`: a script that generates content for the test. It prompts the user for how many times they want to clone the `sample-content` directory.  
- `content/posts`: this directory is dynamically created by `generate.sh`. It has the dummy content usually in the thousands of posts. It is always in `.gitignore`.   
- `benchmark`: hugo site, configuration and theme to benchmark. The theme is very minimal to make sure very few things get in the way of an optimal build.  
- `run_test.sh`: the script that runs the test and captures the output in csv format.
- `data/`: where the csv results are.

# How to run 

**Step 1: Generate dummy content**  

Generate dummy content by running the script `generate.sh` . It will prompt you to enter how many copies you want. 

The script will take whatever is in `sample-content` and clone it x number of times and save the output to `content/posts`

Make sure the generate script has the right permissions then run it by using the following commands:  

- `chmod +x generate.sh`
- `./generate.sh`

The directory `content/posts` is in `.gitignore` to avoid pushing all sorts of random content to github.

**Step 2: Check your hugo install**

Make sure you have hugo running and double check that the theme is working.

- `cd benchmark`
- `git submodule init`
- `git submodule update`
- `hugo` or `hugo server`

TO DO: simplify this step by having the theme stored here not as sub-module.

**Step 3: run test**

Copy the content you generated in the previous step from `content/posts/` to `benchmark/content/posts`. 

The files were not generated in the working directory of hugo to allow for troubleshooting and testing hugo independently.

The commands are: 

- `cp -R content/ benchmark/content/`
- `chmod +x run_test.sh`
- `./run_test.sh`

The script `run_test` will prompt you for how many times you want to run `hugo build`. The time it takes for a build changes slightly between runs even on the same machine.

The script also captures the build times by taking the `hugo build` output and changing it into a csv.

# Existing benchmark

Existing benchmark do say that hugo is pretty fast. But it is unclear what the specs of the machine used in building were or which version.
